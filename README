The truth is, project and personal are not ready yet.  password protection
is my perverted way to frustrate random web surfers.;) jumpgate is however
functional and protection is obvious necessary.  Anyway here is the copy
(pod appended).  Note, the purpose of QuickCheck is, not surprisingly, a
quick check, esp.  for validation of user input in CGI transactions.  I
recommend weblint etc. for offline comprehensive html syntax checking.  I
haven't got time to update it for a while, but the concept and update is
obvious and trivial...

hope it can be of any use to you,

Yeah, sure, just note it is still in beta, may need more extensive
field test.

Thanks for maintaining such a great resource for the benefit of everybody.

Yuck.  I only paid attention to perl 4 compatibility (we have too much
script to use perl 5 as perl).  Why Larry changed the precedence is beyond
me... Anyway here is the fixed version (just added couple of parentheses).
I confess I am not familiar with the MakeMaker...

Thanks for the 'bug' report.
